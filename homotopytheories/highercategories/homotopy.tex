\chapter{Grothendieck's homotopy hypothesis}%
\label{cha:Grothendieckshomotopyhypothesis}

Our approach to constructing the homotopy theory of animae follows a general recipe, which will inform our work throughout this book.
The recipe provides a strategy for designing a homotopy theory $\EE$, using only partial or imperfect information about it:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item%
    Select a piece $\EE_0$ of $\EE$ that is simple enough that you can understand it completely,
    but complex enough so that any object $X \in \EE$ is completely determined by the sets/groups/whatevers of maps $T \to X$ with $T \in \EE_0$.
    In many cases, you'll want $\EE_0$ to generate $\EE$ under suitable colimits.
  \item%
    Now select a small category $J$, usually combinatorial in nature,
    along with an essentially surjective functor $R \colon J \to \EE_0$ (which need not be fully faithful).
    In many cases, it will be helpful if the objects of $J$ come equipped with some notion of \emph{degree}.
    The category $J$ and functor $R$ should be chosen so that some key salient features of general objects $X \in \EE$ can be read off from mapping objects $\Map(R(j),X)$.
  \item%
    Encode these salient features as a set of properties $P$ of the corresponding functors $\Map(R(-),X)$.
    For example, perhaps you'll want to require that for some particular $j \in J$, the object $\Map(R(j),X)$ is trivial.
    Or perhaps such a property expresses $\Map(R(k),X)$ as a limit or colimit of various other mapping objects $\Map(R(j),X)$.
    The objects of your homotopy theory will be exactly the functors $J^{\op} \to \Set$ (or other enriching category) that enjoy these properties of $P$.
\end{enumerate}

In this chapter, we will construct the homotopy theory of animae in this way:
$\EE_0$ will be the homotopy theory of contractible animae (which is trivial),
$J$ is the category of \emph{simplices} $\DDelta$ (defined below),
and $P$ is Kan's \emph{horn-filling condition}.

Other options for $J$ (and therefore $P$) are possible:
there is an interesting class of categories -- the \emph{test categories} -- that can stand in for $\DDelta$. 
These include the category of nonempty finite sets, Joyal's categories $\Theta_n$, as well as various categories of cubes and trees.

One special feature of $\DDelta$ is that it can also be used to define the larger homotopy theory of $\infty$-categories itself.
For this homotopy theory, $\EE_0$ is the homotopy theory of finite ordinals (which is not trivial, but is nevertheless very simple),
$J$ is again the category $\DDelta$,
and $P$ is the \emph{inner horn-filling condition} first identified explicitly by Boardman--Vogt.
