\chapter*{Higher categories \& disposable ladders}%
\label{cha:introduction}

\epigraph{
  My propositions elucidate in the sense that anyone who understands me will eventually recognize them as nonsense, once they have climbed through them -- on them -- beyond them.
  (They must, as it were, throw the ladder away after they have climbed up it.)

  They must surmount these propositions;
  then they will see the world aright.
}{-- Ludwig Wittgenstein, \textit{Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus}, 6.54.}

\noindent%
According to most set-theoretic foundations,
the number $6$ might refer to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item a set with $6$ elements (when viewed as a natural number),
  \item a set with countably many elements (when viewed as an integer or as a rational number), or
  \item a set with uncountably many elements (when viewed as a real number).
\end{itemize}
Working mathematicians do not fret much about this ambiguity, because they know there are preferred injections
\[
  \NN \inclusion \ZZ \inclusion \QQ \inclusion \RR \period
\]
These injections are in fact \emph{unique} with certain simple properties.

Better still, each of these number systems satisfies a universal property:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\NN$ is the free commutative monoid on one generator;
  \item $\ZZ$ is the group completion of $\NN$;
  \item $\QQ$ is the field of fractions of $\ZZ$;
  \item $\RR$ is the Cauchy completion of $\QQ$.
\end{itemize}
Each of these universal properties characterizes maps from these objects in certain categories.

To \emph{construct} these objects set-theoretically and to prove that they have the desired properties is sometimes a chore.
There are often many constructions of the same object.
For example, are real numbers Dedekind cuts, or are they equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences of rational numbers?
If we ask questions that involve the \emph{elements} of a real number, then we can observe differences between these two options. 
But if the kinds of questions we study only involve the things for which we usually use real numbers -- adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing, and taking limits -- then any differences among the various constructions of $\RR$ become irrelevant.

As a result, working mathematicians don't generally regard a question such as \enquote{is $3 \in \pi$?} as \emph{meaningful},
despite the fact that in set-theory-founded mathematics, it technically will admit an answer.
Precisely \emph{because} the answer depends upon the set-theoretic model one chooses of $\RR$,
we know we aren't supposed to ask that sort of question.
That is, we adopt a \emph{structuralist} attitude to the real numbers.
Every complete ordered field has a unique element that deserves the name $\pi$, and
the \emph{meaningful} questions about $\pi$ make reference only to that structure.
Since any pair of complete ordered fields are topologically isomorphic in exactly one way, the answers to meaningful questions will not depend on any particular construction of the complete ordered field.

Now we may still \emph{answer} meaningful questions by appealing to a particular model. 
One is certainly allowed to deduce facts about $\pi$ by thinking of it and working with it as an equivalence class of Cauchy sequences.
But those facts are only taken to be meaningful if they can be stated only with reference to the structures present in a complete ordered field.

This pattern of mathematical development resembles Wittgenstein's parable of the disposable ladder.
We climb the ladder by constructing a mathematical object $X$ set-theoretically.
Once we've done this, we identify the salient \emph{structures} and \emph{properties} of $X$.
We write enough of these down to characterize $X$ uniquely, up to an appropriate notion of \emph{isomorphism}.
The structures will often reveal to us a category $\CC$ of which $X$ should be viewed as an object, and
the properties will identify $X$ uniquely up to unique isomorphism in $\CC$.
We then restrict our attention to the questions about $X$ that can be formulated in terms provided by the category $\CC$,
and we regard questions about $X$ that do \emph{not} admit such formulations as meaningless.
Information about our initial construction of $X$ -- the ladder we used to climb to our understanding of it as an object of $\CC$ -- become not just irrelevant but \emph{uninterrogable}.
We throw away the ladder.

Here is another example.
Let $R$ be a (commutative, unital) ring, and
let $M$ and $N$ be $R$-modules.
The first time many students see the tensor product $M \otimes_R N$,
it is defined via generators and relations:
given a set $S$ of generators of $M$ and a set $T$ of generators of $N$,
define $M \otimes_R N$ as the $R$-module generated by pairs $(x,y)$ -- usually written as $x \otimes y$ and called \emph{simple tensors} -- with $x \in S$ and $y \in T$,
subject to the relations $x \otimes (ry) = (rx) \otimes y = r(x \otimes y)$ and $x \otimes 0 = 0 \otimes y = 0$.
This description is a disposable ladder:
eventually students will understand it as a specific \emph{presentation} of the true object $M \otimes_R N$, 
which is the object representing the functor that carries an $R$-module $T$ to the set of $R$-bilinear mays $M \times N \to T$.

The theory of \emph{higher categories} also follows this pattern, to a point. 
There are many ways to construct a theory of higher categories.
These constructions vary significantly in detail.
However, there are also today a number of different \emph{unicity theorems};
these state that
any two purported models of higher categories satisfying a few sensible axioms are equivalent in an appropriate sense.
In other words, all of these are models of the same structure.
That structure is the \emph{higher category of higher categories}.
We will have more to say about this below.

Before we do, though, we must address the \emph{ouroboros} that makes our story unusual.
After all, $\RR$ is not itself a real number;
one can define complete ordered fields without making reference to an existing theory of real numbers.
And $M \otimes_R N$ is an $R$-module, not an element of $M \otimes_R N$.
But higher categories \emph{do} form a higher category.
One feels a palpable sense of discomfort.
Part of this is a response to the cautionary tale Russell told us about the dangers of self-membership.
But there's something else:
is it not somehow paradoxical to assert that there is a unique higher category of higher categories?
Are we not trying to throw away our ladder while we are still standing on it?
After all, how can one characterize the theory of higher categories as a higher category before one has fully worked out what a higher category is?
And how can one claim to have fully worked out what a higher category is without having characterized the theory of higher categories?

It's not quite as vicious a circle as it may seem.
The strategy is to begin with a definition (in set-theoretic terms) of \emph{putative} higher categories.
We show that putative higher categories form a putative higher category $\categ{Put}$.
(Technically, we will need avoid Russell's paradox with large/small distinctions, but let's ignore this for now.)
Then we uniquely characterize an object $\categ{True}$ of $\categ{Put}$, making reference only to the structure available in $\categ{Put}$.
We call $\categ{True}$ the putative higher category of \emph{true} higher categories.
Then we prove that $\categ{Put}$ satisfies the conditions of our characterization.
Hence the putative higher category $\categ{Put}$ of putative higher categories is equivalent (in a unique fashion) to the putative higher category $\categ{True}$ of true higher categories.

But it is easy to tell a degenerate version of this story.
I define a putative higher category to be a one-point set.
The category $\categ{Put}$ of one-point sets is, up to equivalence, a one-point set itself.
We characterize $\categ{True}$ as the unique object of $\categ{Put}$ (up to unique isomorphism).
Necessarily, $\categ{Put} \cong \categ{True}$.
We were hoping for a theory of higher categories with more content than this!

So the theory of higher categories, as we can develop it today, differs from many other mathematical abstractions in one important respect.
Whereas we eventually find new (and often clearer) structuralist definitions of many mathematical objects,
we do not have a way of defining higher categories without introducing a model of the theory at some point.
We can, for example, give a structuralist definition of \enquote{real number} as an element of a complete ordered field $\RR$;
such a definition doesn't exhibit any preference for any particular construction of $\RR$.
We can also define $M \otimes_R N$ as the object representing the functor $T \mapsto \categ{Bilin}_R(M \times N, T)$;
no need to choose generators.

By contrast, we do not currently know how to give a completely structuralist definition of \enquote{higher category}.
What we have is a structuralist \emph{characterization} of the theory of higher categories, when this theory is regarded as an object in some extant model of higher categories.
So we cannot yet avoid the difficult task of constructing and studying an explicit model of higher categories.
Such a model remains entangled with the theory of higher categories,
even when the goal is a model-independent understanding of the theory.

What this means for higher category theory:
some tools beyond the usual arsenal of categorical techniques will have to be deployed in order to provide an account of higher category theory that is untethered from set-theoretical models.
(Homotopy type theory is probably the most promising approach at the moment.)

What this means for us:
if we are to undertake a well-motivated study of higher categories, then
we will have to take a dialectical approach.
We will spend some time experimenting with some provisional definitions in order to develop good intuitions about the kinds of structures and examples we actually want the theory to capture.
We do not, however, intend to take a historical approach to the theory of higher categories.
The development of higher category theory has been complex and discursive, and
it would be easy for our narrative to degenerate into omphaloskepsis.

Instead, in this book, we will focus on one essential challenge in the theory -- \emph{the question of sameness} -- which will in turn motivate \emph{the homotopical turn} in higher category theory.
