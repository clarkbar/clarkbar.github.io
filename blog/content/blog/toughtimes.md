It is now tiresome to say that we live in turbulent times.
There are plenty of ways in which that's true.
I won't try to list them; you already know them.
And anyhow by the time you read this,
my list would be buried under a crop of fresher outrages.
Maybe turbulence leads to introspection.
Certainly since the pandemic began, I've been asking myself:
"is what I do is really the best use of a human life?"
Perhaps I'm not the only one.

I spend many hours a day absorbed in abstractions.
These abstractions certainly have no material impact on others' lives.
It's difficult to imagine how they might have such an impact in the future.

Any upstanding pure mathematician would now simply have to interrupt
with one of the standard examples.
What about the the RSA public-key encryption system,
which itself only works thanks to Fermat's Little Theorem?
Internet commerce flowed from the 17th-century pen of a compulsive letter-writer fascinated by arithmetic.

These narratives are neither wrong nor even misleading.
We should continue to share them -- even champion them.
But we shouldn't look to these stories to communicate the motivations of mathematicians.
I don't study mathematical objects because I have a vague hope that they'll be useful in a marketplace.
Fermat probably didn't study exponents mod $p$ out of a fond wish that I would one day be able to pay Jeff Bezos to have someone bring me a bottle of ketchup.
There's just too much time and uncertainty between a typical pure mathematician's work and its "economic outputs" for these outputs to serve as their primary motivation.
What's valuable about Fermat's Little Theorem isn't (only) measured in currency.

So what moves us to study mathematics?
There's an aesthetic component, surely:
we speak of beautiful theorems with elegant proofs.
At the same time we claim to report on an objective reality:
a beautiful but incorrect proof is not a finished piece of work.
In fact, the interplay between the subjective and objective is a form of mathematical practice:
you refine your aesthetic responses so that they are as tightly correlated with the truth as you can make them.
-- You only thought that incorrect proof was beautiful -- the real beauty is in the correct argument that it inspired.

The other thing that's at work here is an obsessive curiosity.
A tireless voice repeating
-- You still have a puzzle to solve.
This voice is difficult to interrogate.
You can ask, _what's the point of this bit of mathematics?_
but that question doesn't always parse.
I don't always want to understand things so that I can do something else.
Sometimes I want to understand things, period.
The chain of conscious motivation finds a minimum.

This is a slightly subtle point I'm getting at.
I'm not saying that all pieces of mathematics are equally worth knowing.
Imagine some hideously unnatural algebraic structure
-- 122 different magma structures, satisfying the following 57 relations, etc. --
and imagine the classification theorem for all the finite examples,
the proof of which is simply a lengthy case-analysis with no reference to the rest of mathematics.
And then imagine a proof of the Riemann Hypothesis using a technique that gracefully interweaves deep aspects of 4 or 5 disparate areas of mathematics.
Exactly one of these papers will be worth careful study.

But what I want to say is twofold:
(1) There's a lot of beautiful mathematics that was done largely, maybe entirely,
out of sheer curiosity for the objects in themselves.
(2) In order to make progress, you have to exhibit this sort of curiosity --
enough to contemplate an object for much longer and with more seriousness than you can justify with applications.
So not only is it ok not to have a point, but it's even necessary at times.
(This is somehow connected to Callard's idea of aspiration.
Also to Feyerabend's principle of tenacity.)
