					Let X be a quasicompact quasiseparated scheme.
					Write Gal(X) for the category whose objects are geometric points of X and whose morphisms are specializations in the &eacute;tale topology.
					We define a natural profinite topology on the category Gal(X) that globalizes the topologies of the absolute Galois groups of the residue fields of the points of X.
					One of the main results of this book is that Gal(X) variant of MacPherson's exit-path category suitable for the &eacute;tale topology:
					we construct an equivalence between representations of Gal(X) and constructible sheaves on X. 
					We show that this exodromy equivalence holds with nonabelian coefficients and with finite abelian coefficients.
					More generally, by using the pyknotic/condensed formalism, we extend this equivalence to coefficients in the category of modules over profinite rings and algebraic extensions of <b>Q</b><sub>l</sub>.
					As an exit-path category, the topological category Gal(X) also gives rise to a new, concrete description of the &eacute;tale homotopy type of X.

					We also prove a higher categorical form of Hochster Duality, which reconstructs the entire &eacute;tale topos of a quasicompact and quasiseparated scheme from the topological category Gal(X).
					Appealing to Voevodsky's proof of a conjecture of Grothendieck, we prove the following reconstruction theorem for normal varieties over a finitely generated field k of characteristic 0: the functor that carries X to Gal(X) from normal k-varieties to topological categories over BG<sub>k</sub> and equivariant functors that preserve minimal objects is fully faithful.

The twisted arrow &infin;-category is in turn used to construct the effective Burnside &infin;-category. We employ a variation on this theme to construct a fibrewise effective Burnside &infin;-category. To show that this constuctionworks fibrewise, we introduce a fragment of a theory of what we call marbled simplicial sets, and we use a yet further modified form of the Joyal-Tierney argument.</li>

Here, we characterize simplicial localization functors among relative functors from relative categories to simplicial categories as any choice of homotopy inverse to the delocalization functor of Dwyer and the second author. We employ this characterization to obtain a more explicit description of the weak equivalences in the model category of relative categories mentioned above by showing that these weak equivalences are exactly the DK-equivalences, i.e., those maps between relative categories which induce a weak equivalence between their simplicial localizations.</li>

We then verify the existence of right Bousfield localizations of right model categories, and we apply this to construct a model of the homotopy limit of a left Quillen presheaf as a right model category.</li>
