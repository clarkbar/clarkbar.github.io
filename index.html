        <li><a href="papers/facts.pdf">[ PDF ] </a>Work in progress. Version 1, June 2025.
          There's been interest in the possibility of <i>arithmetic quantum field theories</i>.
          The aim of this paper is to provide a formalism with which one might be able to make sense of the algebra of observables of such theories.
          More generally, this is an attempt to construct a unified theory of <i>factorization algebras</i> over quite general geometries that will include many of the relevant examples and will exhibit good formal properties.
          It currently gets as far as giving a plausible definition, but
          it's just a start.
          Anyone with comments or questions should contact me.

          We accomplish this by extending the Galois category construction to simplicial schemes.
          We also deduce that the nerve of the Galois category of a simplicial scheme is equivalent
          to its &eacute;tale topological type in the sense of Friedlander.</li>

          It is shown that this conjecture holds if and only if

        <li><a href="papers/galperf.pdf">[ PDF ] </a>It turns out that one can read off facts about schemes
          up to universal homeomorphism from their Galois categories.
          Here we propose a first modest slate of entries in a dictionary between

          and the categorical properties of its Galois category (or functor of such).

        <li><a href="papers/exodromy_book.pdf">[ PDF ] </a>Let X be a quasicompact quasiseparated scheme.
          Write Gal(X) for the category whose objects are geometric points of X
          and whose morphisms are specializations in the &eacute;tale topology.
          We define a natural profinite topology on the category Gal(X) that
          globalizes the topologies of the absolute Galois groups of the residue fields of the points of X.
          One of the main results of this book is that
          Gal(X) is a variant of MacPherson's exit-path category suitable for the &eacute;tale topology:
          we construct an equivalence between representations of Gal(X) and constructible sheaves on X.
          We show that this exodromy equivalence holds with nonabelian coefficients and with finite abelian coefficients.
          More generally, by using the pyknotic/condensed formalism,
          we extend this equivalence to coefficients in the category of modules over profinite rings and
          algebraic extensions of <b>Q</b><sub>l</sub>.
          As an exit-path category, the topological category Gal(X) also gives rise
          to a new, concrete description of the &eacute;tale homotopy type of X.

          We also prove a higher categorical form of Hochster Duality,
          which reconstructs the entire &eacute;tale topos of a quasicompact and quasiseparated scheme
          from the topological category Gal(X).
          Appealing to Voevodsky's proof of a conjecture of Grothendieck,
          we prove the following reconstruction theorem
          for normal varieties over a finitely generated field k of characteristic 0:
          the functor that carries X to Gal(X) from normal k-varieties to topological categories over BG<sub>k</sub>
          and equivariant functors that preserve minimal objects is fully faithful.

          we give a new proof that it is an &infin;-category,
          using an extremely helpful modification of an argument due to Joyal-Tierney.
          The twisted arrow &infin;-category is in turn used to construct the effective Burnside &infin;-category.
          We employ a variation on this theme to construct a fibrewise effective Burnside &infin;-category.
          To show that this constuction works fibrewise,
          we introduce a fragment of a theory of what we call marbled simplicial sets, and

          a suitable generalization of the second named author&#8217;s Day convolution,
          we endow the &infin;-category of Mackey functors with a well-behaved symmetric monoidal structure.
          This makes it possible to speak of spectral Green functors for any operad O.
          We also answer a question of A. Mathew, proving that the algebraic K-theory of group actions
          is lax symmetric monoidal.
          We also show that the algebraic K-theory of derived stacks provides an example.
          Finally, we give a very short, new proof of the equivariant Barratt-Priddy-Quillen theorem, which states that
          the algebraic K-theory of the category of finite G-sets is simply the G-equivariant sphere spectrum.

          ordinary Mackey functors as defined by Dress.
          We show that they can be described as excisive functors on a suitable &infin;-category,

          More importantly, we introduce the unfurling of certain families of Waldhausen &infin;-categories bound together

          this construction completely solves the homotopy coherence problem that

          to the delocalization functor of Dwyer and the second author.
          We employ this characterization to obtain a more explicit description of the weak equivalences in the model category
          of relative categories mentioned above by showing that these weak equivalences are exactly the DK-equivalences,
          i.e., those maps between relative categories which induce a weak equivalence between their simplicial localizations.

        <li><a href="papers/complete.pdf">[ PDF ] </a>We verify the existence of left Bousfield localizations and
          of enriched left Bousfield localizations, and we prove a collection of useful technical results
          characterizing certain fibrations of (enriched) left Bousfield localizations.
          We also use such Bousfield localizations to construct a number of new model categories,
          including models for the homotopy limit of right Quillen presheaves, for Postnikov towers in model categories, and
          for presheaves valued in a symmetric monoidal model category satisfying a homotopy-coherent descent condition.
          We then verify the existence of right Bousfield localizations of right model categories, and
          we apply this to construct a model of the homotopy limit of a left Quillen presheaf as a right model category.
